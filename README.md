Repository created after the école 42 basecamp experience.

Most of codes are in C language, only two of them are in shell script.
Obs.: I didn't complete all the lists and exercises.


## What is 42Basecamp?

Is a 20 days bootcamp and a selection process to study at the world wide software engineering school, more precisely, the São Paulo branch. The basecamp has 13 C lists of project to make, and each one has about 5 to 10 challenges to solve. You only could move on to the next list if you graded at least 50% of the present list.

The basecamp was gamefied, it means that you earn badges to accomplish other challenges, like receiving expressive vote from the other participant as a helpfull peer. There are my bagdes:
